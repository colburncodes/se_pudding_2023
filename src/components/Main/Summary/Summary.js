        Who would have thought that singles going to a speed dating event were not mostly 
        interested in getting a date or looking for a relationship? Seriously! If so, 
        it explains our finding that most singles received only 2 matches or less from 17 events.
      </p>

      <p className="sumamary__description">
        There did not seem to be much difference between what singles were looking for and how they graded themselves on those same qualities.
      </p>

      <p className="sumamary__description">
        If the participants were mainly interested in having fun and meeting new people, 
        they may have achieved their goal after all even if that means they did not get matches at the speed dating events.
